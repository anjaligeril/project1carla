Notes for Carla's Classroom, Chapter 7:

This program does not have complete functionality.
Carla cannot save the questions she creates. 
Therefore, for a student to use the program, you
must replace the questions_potter.html file with
the sample_questions_potter.html file that is 
included with the Student Data Files and with 
the Instructor Resources.
